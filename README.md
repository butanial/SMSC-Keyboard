Using the Keyboard
The keyboards will be very similar to what you’re used to, with only a few changes, noted below.
1.	Mobile Devices: 
•	There are 2 options for the letters with diacritical marks.
a.	Unlike the desktop keyboard, additional letters are produced by holding down (long hold) keys. Press and hold any key with the dot in the upper right corner (indicated below with the green arrows), and after a moment a submenu will appear. Continue holding the key and slide to the submenu to select a key. Release, and the selected key from the submenu is output. 


b.	To use the diacritical mark keys, type the letter you need followed by the mark. 
o	Overdot ◌̇ key is located to the left of the a/A key.  
Example 
k + ̇   =  k̇ 
Shift + K + ̇   = K̇


o	Accent ◌́ key is located to the right of the l/L key.
Example 
a + ́    =  á
Shift + A + ´ =  Á 

•	The ŋ/Ŋ keys have been added to the right of the m/M key.
 

2.	Windows/PCs
 
•	To use the Diacritical Marks, type the letter you need followed by the mark. For \|Ŋŋ
o	Overdot ◌̇ replaces the `~ key in the upper left corner of the keyboard. 






o	Accent ◌́ replaces the =+ key in the upper right corner of the keyboard.
 
•	The ŋ/Ŋ replaces the \| key on the right side of the keyboard.
